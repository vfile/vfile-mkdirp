# vfile-mkdirp

**Stability: Legacy**.
This package is no longer recommended for use.
It’s still covered by semantic-versioning guarantees and not yet deprecated,
but use of this package should be avoided.
Please use [`fs.mkdir`][mkdir] with `recursive: true` instead.

Legacy [documentation for this
package](https://github.com/vfile/vfile-mkdirp/tree/a1598ba)
is still available in Git.
